# About

`geocorr` is an R data package for a set of geographic crosswalk files 
generated from the Missouri Census Data Center's [**Geo**graphic **Corr**espondence Engine: `MABLE/Geocorr14`](http://mcdc.missouri.edu/websas/geocorr14.html). 

So far `geocorr` has four datasets:

- `geocorr::county2010_to_puma2000`: County10-PUMA00 Crosswalk File
- `geocorr::county2010_to_puma2012`: County10-PUMA12 Crosswalk File
- `geocorr::county2014_to_puma2000`: County14-PUMA00 Crosswalk File
- `geocorr::county2014_to_puma2012`: County14-PUMA12 Crosswalk File

The raw csv files, generated directly from [`MABLE/Geocorr14`](http://mcdc.missouri.edu/websas/geocorr14.html),
can be found in the [`\data-raw\` folder](https://github.com/jjchern/geocorr/tree/master/data-raw).
